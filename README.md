1. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your attached code? If so, explain.
After testing our code with 500+ different domain names including invalid and non-reachable domain names, it is outputting accurate results. Tested in different and same ilab machine and did not encounter any error that would crash or abruptly stop out code. 

2. Collaboration: Who did you collaborate with on this project? What resources and references did you consult? Please also specify on what aspect of the project you collaborated or consulted.

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project? Around how long did you spend on this project (This helps me decide what I need to explain more clearly for the next projects)
Initially, the first problem we faced was to convert our domain name request into a UDP request, and later was to parse the response from google DNS server to just find 'A' records and ignore CNAMES. On average we spend 1 hour and half each day on the projects, so in total we spent around 10 hours on this project.

4. What interesting thing does you program do to accomplish the task
